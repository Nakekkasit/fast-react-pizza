## Pizza Ordering App with with React JS, Tailwind, Redux
## Deployed App : 👉 [fast-react-pizza](https://fast-react-pizza-7oay.onrender.com/)
### 🏛 Project Requirements:
1. Application, where users can order one or more pizzas from a menu
2. Requires no user accounts and no login: users just input their names before using the app
3. The pizza menu can change, so it should be loaded from an API
4. Users can add multiple pizzas to a cart before ordering
5. Ordering requires just the user’s name, phone number, and address
6. If possible, GPS location should also be provided, to make delivery easier
7. User’s can mark their order as “priority” for an additional 20% of the cart price
8. Orders are made by sending a POST request with the order data (user data + selected pizzas) to the API
9. Payments are made on delivery, so no payment processing is necessary in the app
10. Each order will get a unique ID that should be displayed, so the user can later look up their order based on the ID
11. Users should be able to mark their order as “priority” order even after it has been placed
